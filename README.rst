Waff is Waffle without a back-end. It's for use in sites that are stateless or
that don't have a "conventional" database back-end.

Django Waffle is (yet another) feature flipper for Django. You can
define the conditions for which a flag should be active, and use it in
a number of ways.

For Waff specific details please see docs/starting/waff-only.rst.
